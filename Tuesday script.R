#An R session should begin as an empty space, i.e. there
#should be no *objects* in our environment. 

ls()

#The ls() *function* shows us a *list* of objects in 
#our environment.

#Let's make an object. To make an object, we need a
#name (here "x"), and some value(s) to assign to it.

x <- "Hello world"
x
ls()

#One of R's strengths is the large number of *packages*
#which users have created for different tasks. Packages
#contain functions which we can use on our data.

search()

#The search() function shows us which packages are loaded
#in our R session. 

install.packages("tidyverse")

#The install.packages() function allows us to install new
#packages from the web. Here, we are installing a suite
#of packages known as the "tidyverse".

library("tidyverse")

#Installing a package does not make it available to us in
#our R session. To make a package available, along with
#its functions, we need to use the library() function.

search()

#The tidyverse packages are now listed in our session.

#######
# Help!
#######

#There are many ways of accessing help in R. The help()
#function is the main method. Its shortcut is "?". 

help(tidyverse)
?tidyverse

?persp
example(persp)

#The example() function provides an interactive demo

?dplyr
vignette("dplyr")
browseVignettes(package = "dplyr")

#Some packages have *vignettes*, which go into more 
#detail than R help files (which can be very terse). 
#The vignette() function accesses these, or use
#browseVignettes(package = "name") to search.

help.search("standard deviation")

#If you're looking for help on a particular area, and
#aren't sure what function or package to use, try the
#help.search() function. 

######
# OOPs

#R is an *object-oriented programming language*. This 
#means, essentially, that we make objects with functions
#which we then manipulate with other functions.

rm(list = ls())

#The rm() function can be used to *remove* objects. Here,
#we are passing the contents of the *list* created by
#calling the ls() function which we used earlier. Do
#not worry if this is unclear for now: we are simply 
#clearing our workspace.

x <- "Hello"
class(x)
length(x)

#Here, we assign the value "Hello" to the object "x". 
#The class() function tells us what *class* of object 
#we have just created, in this case an object of 
#class *character*. The length() function tells us how 
#many discrete values or elements the object contains. 
#Here, we have length = 1. Is this the result you were 
#expecting?

x[2] <- "world"
x
length(x)
str_length(x)

#We can use square brackets [] after an object's name to
#access a particular element by its *index*. Indexes in R
#begin at 1. x[1] is therefore "Hello". We can use [] 
#together with the *assignment operator* <- to add an 
#element to x, here the word "world", which will be stored
#in the second index position. We now have a *character 
#vector* of length 2. The str_length() function returns
#the number of characters within each discrete element of
#x, here 5, 5 for [1] Hello, and [2] world.

x <- rnorm(n = 50)
length(x)
mean(x)
sd(x)

#We can use functions to create objects. Here, we use
#rnorm() to create an object comprising 50 *random* 
#numbers drawn from the *normal distribution* family
#(here with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1: 
#these are the default settings for the function).

y <- x
y <- 2*y
lm(y~x)

#A strength of R is that many functions will be applied
#automatically to every element in an object. Here, the
#multiplication function * takes the *scalar* input 2 
#and applies it to each discrete element in y. We then
#simultaneously assign the result of this operation back
#onto y using the assignment operator.

xylm <- lm(y~x)
xylm
attributes(xylm)
summary(xylm)
plot(x,y)

#Many functions return large *lists* of objects. Here, 
#we use the lm() function to apply a linear regression
#of the objects y and x on each other, and assign the 
#results to a new object, xylm. We use the attributes()
#function to list the objects created by lm(). We use
#the summary() function to provide an output of summary
#statistics. Unsurprisingly, we discover that the slope
#of y is 2: when we plot() x and y, they are perfectly
#linear. R provides a helpful warning that this is the
#case in the output of summary().

xylm$residuals
plot(xylm$residuals)

#One of the objects which lm() creates is the value of 
#the *residuals* (i.e. the values "left over" between
#the predicted and actual values of y). We can access 
#these by using the "$" operator. When a function creates
#a *list* of objects, passing the name of the "top level"
#object (here, xylm) followed by $ and then the "lower
#level" object allows us to access the latter. 

###########
# FUNctions
###########

#As well as being an object-oriented language, R is also
#a *functional* language. This essentially means that,
#rather than constantly writing loops in our code, we can
#express iterative behaviour implicitly. 

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

#Here is the long way of creating an object comprising
#a vector of the numbers 1 to 10.

x <- vector("double", 10)
for(i in 1:10){
  x[i] <- i
}  

#Here is a loop doing the same thing.
  
x <- seq(1:10)

#And here is the seq() function doing the same: a large
#saving in mental effort.

y <- x + 11
y <- c(x, 11)

#Be careful though: here, if we want to add the number
#11 onto the end of our sequence, we must use the c()
#function. If we "add" using the + function, R will
#add 11 to each discrete element in x.

?"+"

?"c"

?"<-"

#Every operator is itself a function, as we see by
#calling help on the operator within quote marks.

xMean <- mean(x)
xLength <- length(x)
xDev <- x - xMean
xDevSq <- xDev^2
xSumDevSq <- sum(xDevSq)
xVar <- xSumDevSq/xLength
xSD <- sqrt(xVar)

#Here, we use a number of different functions separately
#to calculate the standard deviation of our sequence, x.
#Does this tally with the result we obtain by calling
#the sd() function?

sd(x)
?sd

#Caution: sd() (and the var() function) assume you are 
#using *sample* statistics, for which the denominator
#is n-1. 

xVar_s <- xSumDevSq/(xLength - 1)
XSD_s <- sqrt(xVar_s)
sd(x)

sd_p <- function(x){
  sd(x)*sqrt((length(x)-1)/length(x))
}

sd_p(x)

#By playing around a little with existing functions, R
#allows us to create a new function which calculates 
#standard deviation for a population. Do not worry about
#what's going on here: the aim is simply to show you how
#using objects and functions allows us to condense our
#workload massively.

#####################
# Taking R for a spin
#####################

#Let's finish by seeing a little of what R is capable of.

?mtcars
summary(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
ls.str(mtcars)

#mtcars is a built-in dataset contained in R's datasets
#library. It is, unsurprisingly, a dataset about cars. 
#The summary() function provides some summary statistics
#of the dataset. The str() function provides information
#about the *structure* of the dataset. The head() function
#provides the first 6 entries in each variable. The 
#ls.str() function combines the ls() and str() functions.
#These are all useful functions to remember when
#exploring a new dataset.

mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, size = hp)) +
  geom_text(aes(size = hp, label = cyl, color = am)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = cyl), color = "grey", size = 0.5, se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +
  guides(size = "none") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.justification = c(1, 1), legend.position = c(1, 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("manual", "automatic"), values = c("blue", "red")) +
  labs(title = "Plot of Fuel Efficiency by Weight for 32 Cars", subtitle = "Number of cylinders; size = horsepower") +
  xlab("weight (1000 lbs)")

#The above example makes use of the ggplot package (a 
#more advanced graphics package than base R graphics)
#to produce a scatter plot which is able simultaneously
#to show the relationship between five variables: the
#weight of the car, its fuel economy, the number of 
#cylinders, its horsepower and type of transmission. 
#Further, three trend lines show the relationship 
#between weight and mpg for 4, 6 and 8 cylinder cars. 
#It is not always a good idea to show so many variables
#simultaneously, but the plot gives a good idea of what
#is possible with R. Again, do not worry about the 
#specifics of the code at this point.
